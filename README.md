Project Explanation: This is the Python Syntax: Medical Insurance Project on the Data Scientist: Analytics pathway on Codecademy. There are certain factors that contribute to medical insurance costs. In this program we estimate a person's yearly insurance costs using a formula, and we find out how various factors such as age, sex, BMI, affect the prediction.

Update: This is an updated version of the original Medical Insurance Project. This code calculates medical insurance costs based on the values passed into the function. Making the code more clean and modular meaning repetitive code is avoided.

Update: This is another update to the original Medical Insurance Project. This code uses lists where we compare the estimated insurance costs to the actual amounts that Maria, Rohan, and Valentina paid.
Also, we calculated the difference between the actual insurance cost data and the estimated insurance cost data for each individual, the results of which are stored in its own individual list.
