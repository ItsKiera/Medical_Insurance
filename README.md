Project Explanation: This is the Python Syntax: Medical Insurance Project on the Data Scientist: Analytics pathway on Codecademy. There are certain factors that contribute to medical insurance costs. In this program we estimate a person's yearly insurance costs using a formula, and we find out how various factors such as age, sex, BMI, affect the prediction.

Update: This is an updated version of the original Medical Insurance Project. This code calculates medical insurance costs based on the values passed into the function. Making the code more clean and modular meaning repetitive code is avoided.
